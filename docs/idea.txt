Pain point:

West parents have a baked-in belief that ‘Asian kids are just better at math’—PISA 2022 ranks Asian Countries First 5, U.S. #28; every major newspaper headline repeats the gap.

Project Idea: 

Our project is to build a web app that shares the “Asian Way” daily drills that made us good at math (refer to PISA, all top 6 good at math are in Asia) . We will share all the practice we did and make it fun and easy to track.  The app will turn these “boring” repetitions into short, colorful challenges with a world leaderboard so kids everywhere can race against our best times and see their own progress.
